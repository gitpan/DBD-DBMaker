Friends, 

This is DBD::DBMaker 0.13.

DBD::DBMaker is a driver code that enables Perl 5.003 and 5.004 to access
the DBMaker RDBMS via the DBI module (you will need the code for the latest
release of DBI and DBD::DBMaker).

Tim Bunce's DBI module is *the* standard way to access a number of different
databases from perl.

DBMAKER is one of the few SQL/ODBC databases engines available for Linux and
for other UNIX and non-UNIX platforms.

This version fixes some bugs and DBI compliance problems:
    IMPORTANT fix: 
    Minor fixes:

Tested using
	* RedHat Linux
	  perl5.005_03
	  DBMaker 3.5

	* WinNT 4.0
	  DBMaker Server 3.5 for WinNT
	  DBMaker 3.5 development system
	  MS VC 5.0
	  perl5.5.005_03

The source of DBD::DBMaker is available from

	http://www.dbmaker.com/
     or from CPAN (authors/id/DBMAKER/DBD-DBMaker-0.13.tar.gz) (not yet)

     You will also need:
    * Perl (of course!), Version 5.003 or better
	* the most recent DBI driver module (currently V 1.06)
	* the DBMaker development system
	* a DBMaker database server

Information about the DBMaker database can be found via
